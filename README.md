# StemSyncVideoEditor
Stem-Sync Video Editor is an automated, beat-locked music video editor for multi-camera and multi-stem workflows. It analyzes song structure and stem energy to drive musical, intentional cuts, supports B-roll injection, and works with live footage, studio sessions, or AI-generated visuals — no manual timeline editing required.
